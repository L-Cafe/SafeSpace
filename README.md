# SafeSpace
Developing the most complete and fully open security alarm for home, businesses, and more.

# Goals

- Presence detection
- Real-time mobile notifications
- Connection to already existing sensors
- Remote arming and disarming
- Silent behaviour for duress situations
- Remote access to listen in, watch video feed, etc.
- Open API with proper authentication for interconnecting with other smart home systems
- Optical and acoustical deterrent features
- Shared and temporary access in case you need to let your family, friends, etc in while you're away
- Battery backup
- Wired and wireless communication options
- Made with relatively easy to obtain parts
- Modular and fully customizable: Use only the features you need or want
- Anti tamper features that trigger the system if sensors or the control unit are moved or manipulated without putting them into maintenance mode
- (maybe?) Control some parts of a smart home, such as smart lightbulbs or smart TVs
